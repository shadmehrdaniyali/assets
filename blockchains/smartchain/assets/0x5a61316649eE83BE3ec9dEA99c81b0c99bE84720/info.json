    "description": "Hello Trust Wallet team,\n\nI previously submitted a pull request for listing my token USDTB under PR #31328, and I completed the payment of 2.5 BNB at the time (TxHash: 0x23464f96fd213fd57ba82e7ffea780ff0a6b8b87b4d77457277da63fc7e6e5d6).\n\nUnfortunately, that PR was closed due to inactivity before it was merged. I have now resubmitted the token under a new PR #31643.\n\nAccording to your official documentation, a second payment is not required if the asset was already accepted before. Since my token was already approved (but not merged), I kindly request you to transfer the paid fee from PR #31328 to PR #31643, so the new request can proceed.\n\nThank you very much for your support and clarification.\n\nBest regards,\nShadmehr Daniyali\nContract: 0x5a61316649eE83BE3ec9dEA99c81b0c99bE84720\n\n",
